# Tennis Matches Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is dedicated to the analysis of tennis match data from the years 2015 to 2023. The primary goal is to identify trends, patterns, and glean useful insights regarding match outcomes, player performance, and tournament characteristics. The project is particularly relevant for sports analytics enthusiasts and those seeking to understand how data analysis can impact strategies in tennis.

## Data Structure
The analysis is based on data organized by year, with a distinction between men's and women's matches. The data includes detailed information about each match, including tournament identifiers, names of the winners, match results, and much more.

## Methodology
The analysis involves several key steps:
- Data preparation, including the processing of missing values and encoding of categorical variables.
- Training linear regression and classification models to predict match outcomes.
- Visualization of the distribution of winners' ages and ranks, as well as analyzing the impact of players' heights on the number of aces served.

## Results
The project demonstrates how data analysis can aid in understanding key aspects of tennis matches. The results include a comparative analysis of classification models and suggestions for model improvements based on the data.

## Conclusion
The study emphasizes the importance of an analytical approach in sports and provides a foundation for further research and strategy development in the field of professional tennis.
